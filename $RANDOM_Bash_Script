✴️ Automating Random Task in Bash With $RANDOM: Real World Organizational Solutions

In many organizations, time and precision are critical. By using the $RANDOM variable in Bash scripting, we can automate repetitive decisions and secure operations, saving time and reducing human error.

Below are three real-world use cases I automated using Bash scripting and $RANDOM:

🔶 PICK A RANDOM USER FOR GROUP OR ORGANIZATIONAL TASK

Manually selecting a team member for a quick task can be slow, biased, and inefficient.

This eliminates bias and time wasted searching through system users.




🔶 PICK RANDOM FILES FOR REVIEW AND EDITING 

The stress of manually choosing files when working with hundreds of files in an open organizational directory is stressful and inefficient.




🔶 CREATE SHA256-SUM TEMPORARY PASSWORD FOR USERS

Creating secure, temporary passwords manually is time-consuming and insecure.

Automating the creation of random SHA256-hashed passwords is fast and reliable.




With just a few lines of code, Bash scripting and the $RANDOM variable empower system admins and DevOps engineers to:
🔶 Eliminate human delays
🔶 Enhance security
🔶 Boost productivity

These scripts can be integrated into cron jobs, automation pipelines, or interactive admin tools.
